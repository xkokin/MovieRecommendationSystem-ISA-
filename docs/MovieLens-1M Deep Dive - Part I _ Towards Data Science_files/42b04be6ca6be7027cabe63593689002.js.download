The toys become uneasy when Andy has his birthday party a week early; to calm them, Sheriff Woody, Andy&#39;s favorite toy and their leader, sends Sarge and his green army men to spy on the gift opening with a baby monitor. The other toys (which include Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Rex the tyrannosaur, Hamm the piggy bank, and Bo Peep the porcelain doll) are relieved when Andy receives nothing that could replace them. Andy then receives a last-minute surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure who believes he is a real space ranger. Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features and becomes Andy&#39;s new favorite, making Woody jealous.The day before the move, Andy&#39;s family plans for a dinner at Pizza Planet, where Andy is allowed to bring along only one toy. To ensure Andy chooses him and not Buzz, Woody tries to use the radio-controlled car RC to knock Buzz behind the desk, but accidentally knocks him out a window instead. The other toys believe Woody deliberately tried to kill Buzz, but Andy arrives and takes Woody before they can exact retribution. A vengeful Buzz stows away in the car, and confronts Woody when the car stops at a gas station on the way to Pizza Planet. The two fight, fall out of the car, and are left behind.After a further argument, the two hitch a ride on a Pizza Planet delivery truck and sneak into the restaurant. Buzz mistakenly believes a claw crane full of Little Green Men to be a true rocket, and Woody climbs in after him. Andy&#39;s sadistic next-door neighbor Sid spots and captures the two and takes them to his house, where they encounter his Bull Terrier Scud and his much-abused &quot;mutant&quot; toys made from parts of other toys he has destroyed.As Woody tries to find an escape route, Buzz is shocked by a TV commercial that reveals he is indeed a toy. In denial, he attempts to fly, but breaks his arm off and falls into despair. After Sid&#39;s toys fix Buzz, Sid returns and tapes Buzz to a large rocket, planning to destroy him but a storm delays his plot. He resolves to enact this the next morning. Woody helps Buzz realize that his purpose is making Andy happy, restoring Buzz&#39;s resolve. Sid takes Buzz out to launch him, but Woody rallies the mutant toys to frighten Sid into never harming toys again, freeing Buzz.Woody and Buzz pursue Andy&#39;s moving truck, but Scud sees them and gives chase, biting Woody. Buzz fights off Scud, while Woody, freed, climbs into the truck and pushes RC out, using him to distract Scud and rescue Buzz. The other toys, thinking Woody is now trying to get rid of RC, toss Woody back into the street. Having escaped Scud, Buzz and Woody pursue the truck on RC, and the other toys spot them coming and realize their error. During the chase, RC&#39;s batteries run out, forcing Woody to ignite the rocket still strapped to Buzz. As they launch towards the truck, they become airborne, and Woody drops RC into the truck. Buzz opens his wings to sever the tape just before the rocket explodes; he and Woody glide over the truck and fall through the sunroof of Andy&#39;s car, landing safely beside Andy.At Christmas, in the new house, Sarge and his men spy on the gift opening again while the other toys wait. Mr. Potato Head is delighted when Molly gets a Mrs. Potato Head, and Woody and Buzz jokingly ponder what gift could be &quot;worse&quot; than Buzz, only to nervously smile at each other when Andy gets a dachshund puppy.<\/td>\n          <\/tr>\n          <tr id=\"file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv-LC3\" class=\"js-file-line\">\n            <td id=\"file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv-L3\" class=\"blob-num js-line-number\" data-line-number=\"3\"><\/td>\n              <td>1<\/td>\n              <td>Jumanji (1995)<\/td>\n              <td>In 1969, Alan Parrish lives with his parents Sam and Carol-Anne in Brantford, New Hampshire. One day, he escapes a group of bullies and retreats to Sam&#39;s shoe company. He meets his friend, Carl Bentley, who reveals a new shoe prototype he made by himself. Alan misplaces the prototype and it damages a machine, but Carl takes responsibility and loses his job. After the bullies attack Alan and steal his bicycle, Alan follows the sound of tribal drumbeats to a construction site. He finds a board game called Jumanji, which was buried a century earlier, and brings it home.That night, after an argument with his father about attending a boarding school, Alan plans to run away, but his friend, Sarah Whittle, returns his bicycle. Alan shows her Jumanji and invites her to play. With each roll of the dice, the game&#39;s piece move by themselves and a cryptic message describing the roll&#39;s outcome appears in the crystal ball at the center of the board. When Sarah takes her first turn, an eerie squeaking sound is heard. Alan then inadvertently rolls the dice after being startled by a chiming clock; he is given a message stating,&quot;In the jungle you must wait, until the dice read five or eight.&quot;, and he is sucked into the game. Afterwards, a colony of bats appears and chases Sarah out of the mansion.Twenty-six years later, in 1995, Judy and Peter Shepherd move into the now-vacant Parrish mansion with their aunt, Nora, after their parents died in an accident on a ski trip in Canada the winter before. Discovering Jumanji in the attic, Judy and Peter begin playing it, resulting in the appearances of giant mosquitoes and a troop of monkeys. The game rules state that everything will be restored when the game ends, so they continue playing. A five is soon rolled, releasing a lion and a now-adult Alan. As Alan makes his way out, he meets Carl, who is now working as a police officer. Alan, Judy and Peter go to the now-abandoned shoe factory, where a homeless man tells Alan that Sam abandoned the business to search for his son after his disappearance until his death four years prior. Eventually, the factory closed, sending Brantford into economic decline.Realizing that they need Sarah to finish the game, the three locate her, now suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder due to both Jumanji and Alan&#39;s disappearance, and persuade her to join them. Sarah&#39;s next move releases fast-growing plant life and Alan&#39;s releases a big-game hunter named Van Pelt, whom Alan first met in the game’s inner world. Judy&#39;s next roll summons a stampeding herd of various animals, including several pelicans, one of which steals the game. Peter retrieves it, but Alan is arrested by Carl. Back in town, the stampede wreaks havoc and Van Pelt steals the game, intent on using it as bait to lure Alan to him.Peter, Sarah and Judy follow Van Pelt into a department store, where they set booby traps to subdue him and retrieve the game, while Alan, after revealing his identity to Carl, is set free. When the four return to the mansion, it is now completely overrun by jungle wildlife. They release one calamity after another until Van Pelt arrives. When Alan drops the dice, he wins the game which causes everything that happened as a result of the game to be reversed.Alan and Sarah return to 1969, just in time for Alan to reconcile with Sam, who tells him that he does not have to attend the boarding school, and confess that he was responsible for damaging the factory&#39;s machine, insuring Carl&#39;s job is kept. After realizing that they have memories of the events that took place, Alan and Sarah throw Jumanji into a river, then share a kiss.In an alternate version of the present, Alan and Sarah are married and expecting their first child. Alan&#39;s parents are still alive as Alan is now successfully running the family business. Alan and Sarah meet Judy, Peter, and their parents Jim and Martha for the first time during a Christmas party. Alan offers Jim a job after they convince them to cancel their upcoming ski trip, averting their deaths.Elsewhere, two young girls hear drumbeats while walking on a beach. Jumanji is seen lying partially buried in the sand.<\/td>\n          <\/tr>\n          <tr id=\"file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv-LC4\" class=\"js-file-line\">\n            <td id=\"file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv-L4\" class=\"blob-num js-line-number\" data-line-number=\"4\"><\/td>\n              <td>2<\/td>\n              <td>Grumpier Old Men (1995)<\/td>\n              <td>The feud between Max (Walter Matthau) and John (Jack Lemmon) has cooled and they have become good friends. Their children, Melanie (Daryl Hannah) and Jacob (Kevin Pollak), have become engaged. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to new wife Ariel (Ann-Margret). John and Max still call each other &quot;moron&quot; and &quot;putz&quot; respectively, but with friendly intentions.The spring and summer fishing season is in full swing with the annual quest to catch &quot;Catfish Hunter,&quot; an unusually large catfish that seems to enjoy eluding anyone that tries to catch it. However, the local bait shop closed after Chuck, the previous owner, died in the first movie. Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren) has purchased the property with the intent of converting it into a fancy Italian restaurant.Irritated it will no longer be a bait shop, Max and John join forces to sabotage the restaurant. They are successful at first with their practical jokes. However, when Ariel learns what is going on, she tells John to apologize to Maria at once, and he does after Ariel kicks him out of the house. Max and Maria begin dating after discovering a shared passion for fishing, while her mother Francesca (Ann Morgan Guilbert) dates John&#39;s father, J.W. (Burgess Meredith).To complicate things further, Jacob and Melanie call off their engagement due to stress from their parents&#39; involvement. Upon hearing the news, John and Max reignite their feud and go back to their childish pranks again such as John cutting a hole in Max&#39;s fishing net and detaching the anchor to his boat. Max retaliates by disconnecting John&#39;s motor from his boat and broadcasting him nude (while Ariel was making a clay statue of him) at a Sears department store. Ariel is stressed out because of it and leaves John until things settle down. At the restaurant, Francesca is worried about all the time Maria spends with Max. She reminds her daughter of her five failed marriages and worries that Max will make it six.After being convinced to take a long look at herself, Maria reluctantly stops seeing Max. Distraught over losing Ariel, John heads to the lake for his father&#39;s advice but finds that he has died in his favorite spot with a fishing pole in one hand and a can of beer in the other. Following the funeral and the spreading of J.W.&#39;s ashes in the lake, John and Max call off their feud again.After realizing that their own inability to properly plan a wedding is what drove their kids to call it off, they decide to set it right. They help Jacob and Melanie reconcile, explaining their drama. John decides to reconcile with Ariel and convinces Max to talk to Maria. He does and convinces her to take a chance on him, while convincing her mother that he&#39;s not going to be like her previous sons-in-laws. John and Max manage to catch &quot;Catfish Hunter&quot; but they reluctantly decide to release it so it can be with J.W. in the lake. After they let it go, they realize that they&#39;re late for a wedding happening in town and rush to the church as quickly as they can. The wedding is revealed to be for Max and Maria, who have reconciled (Jacob and Melanie have eloped). On the way to their honeymoon, they discover Max&#39;s one-eyed bulldog, Lucky, in the car with them, being put there by John earlier as a prank. Ragetti&#39;s is also reformed so it will be both a restaurant and a bait shop.<\/td>\n          <\/tr>\n          <tr id=\"file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv-LC5\" class=\"js-file-line\">\n            <td id=\"file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv-L5\" class=\"blob-num js-line-number\" data-line-number=\"5\"><\/td>\n              <td>3<\/td>\n              <td>Waiting to Exhale (1995)<\/td>\n              <td>Four friends (Savannah, Robin, Bernadine, and Gloria) get together frequently to support one another and listen to each other vent about life and love. They each want to be in a romantic relationship but they each have difficulties finding a good man.Successful television producer Savannah &quot;&#39;Vannah&quot; Jackson believes that one day her married lover will leave his wife for her. She later realizes that he won&#39;t, and that she must find her own man who will love her for who she really is.Bernadine &quot;Bernie&quot; Harris, who abandoned her career dream of having a catering business, instead raised a family and supported her husband. He announces he is leaving her for a white woman with whom he works.Robin Stokes is a high-powered executive and the long-time mistress of married Russell. After dumping him, she has problems finding someone suitable.Beauty salon owner Gloria &quot;Glo&quot; Matthews is a single mother.

Gloria eventually falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin King.The situations all resolve themselves for the better. Savannah ends up permanently dumping her married lover. Bernadine gets a large divorce settlement from her ex-husband and finds love with a widowed civil rights attorney who encourages her to pursue her catering dream. Robin ends up pregnant by her married lover, but dumps him, and chooses to raise the baby on her own. Gloria apologizes to her neighbor for snapping at him when he suggested that she should let her son grow up and experience the world. She learns not to be so protective of her son and lets him go on an &quot;Up with People&quot; trip to Spain.

Shortly thereafter, Annie tells the family that she&#39;s pregnant. George begins to mildly panic, insisting he is too young to be a grandfather. He has his assistant make a list of people who are older than him, dyes his hair brown, and decides he and Nina should sell the home their children have grown up in if one more thing goes wrong with it.Termites strike the house two weeks later. George puts the house on the market without telling Nina, and sells it to the Habibs. At dinner, after a discussion on whether the baby&#39;s last name will be hyphenated or not, George reveals the house has been sold. Nina is livid, as she and George have to be out in 10 days and have no place to go. The Banks stay at the mansion owned by Bryan&#39;s parents. As the MacKenzies are on a cruise in the Caribbean, the Banks have to deal with their vicious Dobermans, much to the chagrin of George, who is still paranoid from a previous mishap with them. Nina begins experiencing symptoms that bring up the concern of menopause. After visiting the doctor the following day, they are given the opposite news: Nina is pregnant, too.Following the unexpected news of Nina&#39;s pregnancy, they have a chance meeting with Franck, Annie&#39;s former wedding planner, who is elated at both women expecting. George has switched gears, now believing he is too old to be a father again. His feelings come to a head when he and Nina go to Annie&#39;s and Bryan&#39;s house to announce their news. Nina brings his insensitivity to light and tells him not to come home. As an apology, George reluctantly hires Franck to do the baby shower. As they are driving home, Nina and George have differing perspectives on the prospect of becoming new parents again. Both express how strange it will be, but begin to welcome the change.Out for a walk, George notices that the street to their old house is blocked off and sees a demolition crew with a wrecking ball at the house, learning that Mr. Habib plans to demolish it. An upset George runs in and tries to stop them as the wrecking ball is about to slam into the house. He pleads with Mr. Habib not to tear down the house since he is going to be a father again, as there is great sentimental value to it. He realizes that if he&#39;s going to have another child, he wants to raise him/her in the house his family grew up in. When George offers to buy the house back, Habib agrees on the condition that George pay him \$100,000 up front. Although reluctant to pay that money, he gives in. The Banks then move back into their house, right as Bryan is called away to an emergency meeting in Japan.Meanwhile, Nina and Annie are moving along in their simultaneous pregnancies and need around the clock care from George. Matty takes over when his father George is away at work. Franck turns simple redecoration of Nina and George&#39;s new baby&#39;s nursery into a full-scale renovation/addition, which he affectionately calls, &#39;the baby&#39;s suite&#39;. Eventually, all the stress and nights of sleep deprivation wear George out. When &#39;the baby&#39;s suite&#39; is revealed, Franck offers George some sleeping pills from his native country called &#39;Vatsnik&#39; after George tells him that he has not been getting enough sleep. George unknowingly takes too high of a dosage and suddenly passes out during dinner. The family becomes worried, which is only increased when Annie finally goes into labor.Franck takes over the role of driving the family to the hospital with a barely coherent George in tow. After being mistaken for a patient in need of a prostate exam, George finally regains full consciousness and goes to see Nina when she goes into labor. George is initially cynical about the female obstetrician who fills in because their own is unavailable. Despite wanting his grandchild to be delivered by the same doctor who delivered his children, George comes to terms with the arrangement. Bryan soon returns to be with Annie, who gives birth to a baby boy, while Nina at the same moment gives birth to a baby girl, named George and Megan, respectively. As George holds his grandson and daughter in his arms, he delivers the stand-out line of the movie - &quot;Life doesn&#39;t get any better than this&quot;. George finishes telling the story about Nina and Annie&#39;s pregnancies. Bryan and Annie then move to Boston with baby George, since Annie took a job there. The film concludes with George standing on the road in front of his house, admiring it with Megan by his side. As he completes the story, he begins walking up the driveway, telling Megan about all the basketball tricks George will teach her.<\/td>\n          <\/tr>\n      <\/tbody>\n    <\/table>\n  <\/div>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n  <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n      <\/div>\n      <div class=\"gist-meta\">\n        <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/erap129/42b04be6ca6be7027cabe63593689002/raw/4a40c8f03213103a83c3e2a49f1784f858c3d136/recsys_movie_plots_head.csv\" style=\"float:right\" class=\"Link--inTextBlock\">view raw<\/a>\n        <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/erap129/42b04be6ca6be7027cabe63593689002#file-recsys_movie_plots_head-csv\" class=\"Link--inTextBlock\">\n          recsys_movie_plots_head.csv\n        <\/a>\n        hosted with &#10084; by <a class=\"Link--inTextBlock\" href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub<\/a>\n      <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n')
